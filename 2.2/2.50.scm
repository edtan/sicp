;Exercise 2.50.  Define the transformation flip-horiz, which flips painters horizontally, and transformations that rotate painters counterclockwise by 180 degrees and 270 degrees.

(define (flip-horiz painter)
  (transform-painter painter
                     (make-vect 1.0 0.0)   ; new origin
                     (make-vect 0.0 0.0)   ; new end of edge1
                     (make-vect 1.0 1.0))) ; new end of edge2

(define (rotate-180 painter)
  (transform-painter painter
                     (make-vect 1.0 1.0)   ; new origin
                     (make-vect 0.0 1.0)   ; new end of edge1
                     (make-vect 1.0 0.0))) ; new end of edge2

(define (rotate-270 painter)
  (transform-painter painter
                     (make-vect 0.0 1.0)   ; new origin
                     (make-vect 0.0 0.0)   ; new end of edge1
                     (make-vect 1.0 1.0))) ; new end of edge2
